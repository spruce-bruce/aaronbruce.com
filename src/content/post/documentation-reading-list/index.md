## On the Subject of Documentation

I have never in my career worked on systems that have had good documentation. I've tended to believe in the idea that code should be self-documenting and self-describing. I still believe that, but I do believe there's a lot of missing nuance if you shut down a conversation about documentation with that line.

Effective documentation has become more interesting to me since [Synapse](https://synapsestudios.com) has both grown and gone fully remote.

## The Purpose of Documentation

1. Onboarding new team members.
1. Reference for old team members.
1. Sharing Information
1. Alignment

## Deciding What to Document

Document things that don't change. Prefer things like decision logs that require no maintenance.

## Resources
I've been reading a lot of Will Larson lately, so what follows is mostly a ton of links to blog posts he's written that touch of the subject of documentation.
